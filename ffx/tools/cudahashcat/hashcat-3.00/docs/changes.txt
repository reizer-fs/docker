## Improvements
##

- Reordering of files to help integration into linux distributions ~/.hashcat etc
- Use a profile directory to write temporary files (session, potfile etc.)
- Workaround depencies on AMD APP-SDK AMD ADL, NV CUDA-SDK, NV ForceWare, NVML and NVAPI; they are no longer required
- Load external libraries dynamic at runtime instead of link them static at compile-time
- Benchmark accuracy improved; Is now on par to: singlehash -a 3 -w 3 ?b?b?b?b?b?b?b
- Benchmark no longer depends on a fixed time
- Removed option --benchmark-mode, therefore support --workload-profile in benchmark-mode
- Enabled support of --machine-readable in combination with --benchmark for automated benchmark processing
- Replaced --status-automat entirely with --machine-readable to make it more consistent among benchmark and non-benchmark mode
- Extended support from 14 to 255 functions calls per rule
- Extended password length up to 32 for 7zip
- Extended salt length up to 55 for raw hash types, eg: md5($pass.$salt)
- Extended version information
- Removed some duplicate rules in T0XlCv1, d3ad0ne and dive
- Redesigned changes.txt layout
- Redesigned --help menu layout

##
## Bugs
##

- Fixed a bug in speed display: In some situation, especially with slow hashes or lots of salts, it showed a speed of 0H/s
- Fixed a bug in restore handling: user immediately aborting after restart broke the restore file
- Fixed a bug in line counter: conditional jump or move depends on an uninitialised value
- Fixed a bug in rule-engine for NVidia devices: code for left- and right-shift were switched
- Fixed a bug in dive.rule: rules were not updated after the function 'x' was renamed to 'O'
- Fixed a bug in memory allocation "OpenCL -4 error": used unitialized value in a special situation
- Fixed a bug in memory handling: heap buffer overflow
- Fixed a bug in memory handling: out of bounds access
- Fixed a bug in implementation of DCC2: forced default iteration count for hashes to 10240
- Fixed a bug in implementation of WPA/WPA2: MAC and nonce stay one their original position as in the hccap file
- Fixed a bug in implementation of GOST R 34.11-94: zero length passwords were not cracked

##
## Technical
##

- Removed deprecated GCC version check requirement
- Removed NPROCS from Makefile, let make automatically detect the optimal number of parallel threads
- Dropped all C++ overloading functions to normal function which helps support more OpenCL platforms
- Renamed functions in common.h to emphasize their purpose
- Refactorized fast-hash kernels to enable SIMD on all OpenCL platforms
- Refactorized SIMD handling: SIMD the inner-loop not the outer-loop to save registers
- Workaround missing clEnqueueFillBuffer() support in certain OpenCL runtimes
- Added amd_bytealign() support in non-AMD OpenCL runtimes
- Added amd_bfe() support in non-AMD OpenCL runtimes
- Added several macros to allow writing optimized code for the different OpenCL platforms
- Replaced typedef for bool with stdbool.h
- Added special DEBUG environment variables to the makefile
- Hashcat now acquires an exclusive lock before writing to any file
- Changed buffers to not use same buffer for both input and output at the same time with snprintf()
- Check for allocatable device-memory depending on kernel_accel amplifier before trying to allocate
- Added additional check for max. ESSID length to prevent possible crashes
- Use a GCC equivalent for __stdcall where applicable
- Synchronize maximum output line size with input line size
- Increased maximum hash line size to 0x50000
- Run weak-hash checks only in straight-attack mode, this greatly reduces code complexity
- Restrict loopback option to straight attack-mode
- Moved rules_optimize to hashcat-utils
- Stick to older libOpenCL in binary package to avoid errors like this: version `OPENCL_2.0' not found
- Tightened hash parser for several algorithms
- Updated old RC4 code in Kerberos 5
- Limited the salt length of Juniper Netscreen/SSG (ScreenOS) hashes to 10
- Updated algorithm used to automatically select an ideal --scrypt-tmto value
- Renamed option --gpu-accel to --kernel-accel
- Renamed option --gpu-loops to --kernel-loops
- Renamed option --gpu-devices to --opencl-devices
- Added inline declaration to functions from simd.c, common.c, rp.c and types_ocl.c to increase performance
- Dropped static declaration from functions in all kernel to achieve OpenCL 1.1 compatibility
- Added -cl-std=CL1.1 to all kernel build options
- Created environment variable to inform NVidia OpenCL runtime to not create its own kernel cache
- Created environment variable to inform pocl OpenCL runtime to not create its own kernel cache
- Dropped special 64-bit rotate() handling for NV, it seems that they've added it to their OpenCL runtime
- Completely get rid of HAVE_ADL, HAVE_NVML and HAVE_NVAPI in sources
- Replaced NVAPI with NVML on windows
